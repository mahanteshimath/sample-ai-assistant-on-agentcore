Project long-term memory tool for Sparky Agent.

Retrieves project-relevant insights extracted from past sessions via
AgentCoreMemoryStore. The composite_actor_id helper encodes both user_id and
project_id into the actorId field, partitioning memories per user×project
without requiring a separate memory strategy per project.

The project_id and user_id arguments are injected by SparkyMiddleware.
