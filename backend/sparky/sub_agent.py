"""
Sub-agent tool for the Research Agent.

Exposes a `sub_agent` tool that the parent Research Agent can call to delegate
focused research sub-tasks. Each invocation spins up a fresh, stateless agent
(no checkpointer, no shared conversation state). The sub-agent runs on
Claude Sonnet 4.6 at effort "medium" and has access to:

  * Tavily search and extract tools (always available, sharing the parent's
    Tavily client instances).
  * Any extra MCP tools the parent explicitly opts in via `extra_tools`. The
    `extra_tools` argument is typed as a `Literal[...]` of the parent's
    currently-active MCP tool names, so the model literally cannot pass a
    name outside that set.

Only the sub-agent's final assistant text is returned to the parent.

You operate stateless: you do not see prior conversation, you do not maintain memory across calls, and you should not ask clarifying questions back to the user. Treat the request you receive as the complete brief.

Use the tools available to you to gather the information needed, then return a clear, well-grounded answer to the parent agent. Cite the sources you actually used. Be concise — the parent will integrate your output into a larger response, so prefer dense, factual prose over headings, bullets, or formatting flourishes. If the request cannot be completed with the tools you have, say so plainly and explain what is missing rather than guessing.

SUB_AGENT_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Delegate a focused, self-contained research sub-task to a stateless sub-agent.

Use this when a sub-question can be answered independently and you want isolated context (e.g., to explore one angle in depth without polluting your own context with intermediate search results).

The sub-agent is stateless — it does not see prior conversation and does not persist across calls. It runs on Claude Sonnet 4.6 with medium reasoning. By default it has tavily_search and tavily_extract. You can opt it into additional tools via `extra_tools`, but only tool names that are currently available to you may be passed; unknown names are rejected.

Args:
    system_prompt: Additional system-prompt guidance specific to this sub-task. Concatenated after the sub-agent's built-in default prompt. Use this to focus the sub-agent (e.g., "You are researching FDA Phase III trial outcomes for drug X. Prioritize primary sources.").
    request: The actual task / human request the sub-agent should fulfill. Must be self-contained — include any context, definitions, or constraints the sub-agent needs, since it has no access to the parent conversation.
    extra_tools: Optional list of additional MCP tool names to enable for the sub-agent. Must be a subset of the MCP tools currently available to you. Tavily search/extract are always available and do not need to be listed here.

Returns:
    The sub-agent's final answer as plain text.

    Build the `sub_agent` tool bound to a specific parent session.

    The tool's `extra_tools` field is dynamically typed as a `Literal[...]` of

    names that it actually has access to.

    Args:
